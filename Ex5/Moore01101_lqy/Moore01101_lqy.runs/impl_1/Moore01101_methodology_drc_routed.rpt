2. REPORT DETAILS
-----------------
LUTAR-1#1 Warning
LUT drives async reset alert  
LUT cell FSM_sequential_currentstate[2]_i_1, with 2 or more inputs, drives asynchronous preset/clear pin(s) FSM_sequential_currentstate_reg[0]/CLR, FSM_sequential_currentstate_reg[1]/CLR, FSM_sequential_currentstate_reg[2]/CLR, outputSignal_reg/CLR. The LUT may glitch and trigger an unexpected reset, even if it is a properly timed path.
Related violations: <none>

LUTAR-1#2 Warning
LUT drives async reset alert  
LUT cell count[2]_i_3, with 2 or more inputs, drives asynchronous preset/clear pin(s) count_reg[0]/CLR, count_reg[1]/CLR, count_reg[2]/CLR. The LUT may glitch and trigger an unexpected reset, even if it is a properly timed path.
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-17#1 Warning
Non-clocked sequential cell  
The clock pin FSM_sequential_currentstate_reg[0]/C is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-17#2 Warning
Non-clocked sequential cell  
The clock pin FSM_sequential_currentstate_reg[1]/C is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-17#3 Warning
Non-clocked sequential cell  
The clock pin FSM_sequential_currentstate_reg[2]/C is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-17#4 Warning
Non-clocked sequential cell  
The clock pin count_reg[0]/C is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-17#5 Warning
Non-clocked sequential cell  
The clock pin count_reg[1]/C is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-17#6 Warning
Non-clocked sequential cell  
The clock pin count_reg[2]/C is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-17#7 Warning
Non-clocked sequential cell  
The clock pin outputSignal_reg/C is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-20#1 Warning
Non-clocked latch  
The latch FSM_sequential_nextstate_reg[0] cannot be properly analyzed as its control pin FSM_sequential_nextstate_reg[0]/G is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-20#2 Warning
Non-clocked latch  
The latch FSM_sequential_nextstate_reg[1] cannot be properly analyzed as its control pin FSM_sequential_nextstate_reg[1]/G is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-20#3 Warning
Non-clocked latch  
The latch FSM_sequential_nextstate_reg[2] cannot be properly analyzed as its control pin FSM_sequential_nextstate_reg[2]/G is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>
